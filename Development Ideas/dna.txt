Interpretation
--------------
The DNA is the build order - bases are followed in order.
The next base is not executed until the previous is executed.
The current base is executed as soon as there is enough money
(this will probably be done by checking colours of buttons**)

**Checking colours of buttons.
Sometimes the buttons to build the towers will not be highlighted
even if conditions are met.

Not Allowed
